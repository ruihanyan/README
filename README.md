**Learning Computing Independently**

Before the course started I thought computing was all about programming, coding and learning various computer hardware, which I knew nothing about. I was anxious because I didn't know any maths. How could I start to learn? 

With my doubts, I first watched two videos on the padlet which gave me an initial knowledge of computing and how graphic design interacts with technology, such as using software and doing typography in phython. In the video, Jazmin solved my problem, she said

> Creative computing is way more than code. It can be physical, it can be electronic and can be experienced.

The open source is also mentioned in the material, where claims

> What's in your brain and how you can convey that is what is unique to you

It gives people the opportunities to learn, to remix and make their own. The open-source software made it a lot easier for me to learn Arduino later.

**Learning Arduino and Having Tutorial with Maggie**

This was the part of learning that I think was hard to understand. It needed a lot of physical knowledge to learn Arduino, like doing experiments to make the LED light up using the digital output of Arduino. As I was learning remotely I couldn't actually complete the experiment, but the tutorials helped me a lot and there are annotations in thinkerCAD which also gave me a more in-depth knowledge.

**Learning README file and Markdown**

After having an understanding of creative computing, I learned how to write a README File and try to create it on GitHub. I knew how to use the basic syntax and format in the application, and started making my README File about Learning Log and Reflection.
